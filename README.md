STORY :

Welcome my dear friend!
We are gonna play an interesting game now.

So the game goes like this.....

Level 1:

There was once a hardworking farmer. One day, he had gone to work in his fields. When he returned home, his child was nowhere to be found. Sometime later, through his neighbours , he discovered that his child had been taken away by a stranger. He found some footsteps on the ground, which were probably of the stranger. Following them , he came inside a tunnel which was very scary. 

:: This is a private underground tunnel owned by the stranger.


Now we are given the task of helping the farmer. There are many clues in the tunnel which will help you get to the stranger. 

clue 1 :(beginning of the tunnel)

Since you now have to help, go to the place where chocolate would melt.



clue 2:(ignited fire at a random spot)

since now you are warm, go check 'TO BE FOLLOWED" norms. 

clue 3:(above the list which contains norms)

It seems now you are aware , open something that scares!

clue 4 : (inside a box which contains a skull)

since now you are scared, find something that soothes you!

clue 5 :(a glass of juice on a table)
